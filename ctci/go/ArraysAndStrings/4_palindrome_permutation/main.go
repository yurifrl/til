// Palindrome Permutation
//
// Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome.
// A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
// A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
// The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
//
// EXAMPLE
// Input: Tact Coa
// Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
