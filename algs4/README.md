# Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

### Dynamic Connectivity

- Steps to developing a usable algorithm
  - Model the problem
  - Find an algorithm to solve it
  - Fast enough? Fits in memory?
  - If not, figure out why
  - Find a way to address the problem
  - Iterate unitl satisfied

### Quick Find

### Quick Union: Id array, index point to index

## Quotes

- if a have array with N elements N - 1 everyone exept 1 its 9 if N = 10
- Quick find is not good because it loops thow all the array
