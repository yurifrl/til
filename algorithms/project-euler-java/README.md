# Project Euler Java

## Data Structures Notes
- HashSet doesn't allow duplicates

## Prime notes
- To check that a number is prime, from worst to better:
  - Check if any number divide into it
  - Only check if primes divede into it
  - Only if primes up to the square root divide in to it

## Problem 09

- Prime factorization
  - Find the prime factorization by finding the primes that divide the target
  - 75 = 3 * 5 * 5
  - exponential motation 75 = 3 * 5^2
- Refreshers: Prime is a number divisible by 1 and itself
